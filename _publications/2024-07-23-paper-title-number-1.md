excerpt: 'To solve the problem of lack of trust in cloud platforms, we propose an image encryption algorithm based on the Lattice Hash function and privacy protection in this paper. A new chaotic system using Tent Map and Sine Map is designed in our proposed scheme, which does not have a period window. Meanwhile, our algorithm uses a new chaos system to provide random matrices F for Lattice Hash functions. The image feature vector and the initial key are also employed to obtain the security key, which can be used as input to the Lattice Hash. Besides, our algorithm utilizes the Paillier cryptosystem to encrypt the feature vector as the ciphertext image index for higher security. In addition, the 2D-Line map is improved and applied as a function for scrambling pixel positions to avoid the problem of storing pixel subscripts. Simulation experiments and security analysis shows that our proposed algorithm can resist differential attacks, statistical attacks, brutal attacks. Therefore, our scheme has good security performance and allows precise search over the ciphertext.'

To solve the problem of lack of trust in cloud platforms, we propose an image encryption algorithm based on the Lattice Hash function and privacy protection in this paper. A new chaotic system using Tent Map and Sine Map is designed in our proposed scheme, which does not have a period window. Meanwhile, our algorithm uses a new chaos system to provide random matrices F for Lattice Hash functions. The image feature vector and the initial key are also employed to obtain the security key, which can be used as input to the Lattice Hash. Besides, our algorithm utilizes the Paillier cryptosystem to encrypt the feature vector as the ciphertext image index for higher security. In addition, the 2D-Line map is improved and applied as a function for scrambling pixel positions to avoid the problem of storing pixel subscripts. Simulation experiments and security analysis shows that our proposed algorithm can resist differential attacks, statistical attacks, brutal attacks. Therefore, our scheme has good security performance and allows precise search over the ciphertext.
