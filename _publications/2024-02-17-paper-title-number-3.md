excerpt: 'This paper proposes an image encryption scheme based on logistic quantum chaos. Firstly, we use compressive sensing algorithms to compress plaintext images and quantum logistic and Hadamard matrix to generate the measurement matrix. Secondly, the improved flexible representation of the quantum images (FRQI) encoding method is utilized for encoding the compressed image. The pixel value scrambling operation of the encoded image is realized by rotating the qubit around the axis. Finally, the quantum pixel is encoded into the pixel value in the classical computer, and the bit-level diffusion and scrambling are performed on it. Numerical analysis and simulation results show that our proposed scheme has the large keyspace and strong key sensitivity. The proposed scheme can also resist standard attack methods such as differential attacks and statistical analysis.'

This paper proposes an image encryption scheme based on logistic quantum chaos. Firstly, we use compressive sensing algorithms to compress plaintext images and quantum logistic and Hadamard matrix to generate the measurement matrix. Secondly, the improved flexible representation of the quantum images (FRQI) encoding method is utilized for encoding the compressed image. The pixel value scrambling operation of the encoded image is realized by rotating the qubit around the axis. Finally, the quantum pixel is encoded into the pixel value in the classical computer, and the bit-level diffusion and scrambling are performed on it. Numerical analysis and simulation results show that our proposed scheme has the large keyspace and strong key sensitivity. The proposed scheme can also resist standard attack methods such as differential attacks and statistical analysis.
