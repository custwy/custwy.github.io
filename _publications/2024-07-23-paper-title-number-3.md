excerpt: 'To protect privacy, many users opt to encrypt images prior to outsourcing them to cloud service platforms (CSPs). However, this encryption process results in the loss of image features and subsequent inability to retrieve them. We propose an image encryption and retrieval algorithm, which ensures that privacy is not leaked in both the upload and retrieval stages. First, overcoming the insufficient security and degradation in chaotic systems, we introduce the time-varying functions, and unscented Kalman filter to improve the non-adjacent coupled map lattice complexity and security. Secondly, considering the encryption efficiency, we compress the plaintext image to reduce the time of the encryption phase and improve the overall encryption speed. Finally, we use the locally sensitive hash (LSH) for feature vector dimensionality reduction to improve the retrieval efficiency and perform a secondary LSH on the reduced feature vector to form a new hash-key retrieval structure in the generate index phase, which improves the retrieval efficiency. The experimental results prove that our proposed encryption algorithm can meet the image encryption algorithms high retrieval accuracy and multi-user without revealing privacy.'

To protect privacy, many users opt to encrypt images prior to outsourcing them to cloud service platforms (CSPs). However, this encryption process results in the loss of image features and subsequent inability to retrieve them. We propose an image encryption and retrieval algorithm, which ensures that privacy is not leaked in both the upload and retrieval stages. First, overcoming the insufficient security and degradation in chaotic systems, we introduce the time-varying functions, and unscented Kalman filter to improve the non-adjacent coupled map lattice complexity and security. Secondly, considering the encryption efficiency, we compress the plaintext image to reduce the time of the encryption phase and improve the overall encryption speed. Finally, we use the locally sensitive hash (LSH) for feature vector dimensionality reduction to improve the retrieval efficiency and perform a secondary LSH on the reduced feature vector to form a new hash-key retrieval structure in the generate index phase, which improves the retrieval efficiency. The experimental results prove that our proposed encryption algorithm can meet the image encryption algorithms high retrieval accuracy and multi-user without revealing privacy.
